# aibjj
This is a repository for trying to make ai learn bjj. Mainly, I'll be trying to use google deepminds mujoco to go try and teach an AI how to do bjj. Might need some reinforcement learning as well.

#Instructions
pip install mujoco (or pip install -r requirements.txt)
Use python -m mujoco.viewer and drag in drop the 2_humanoids.xml file and cycle through the key frames to see the different positions of bjj
